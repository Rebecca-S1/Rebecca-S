## My name is Rebecca Sitrin....

...and I am a sophomore here at CNU. My pronouns are she/her, and I am majoring in Communication with minors in Digital Humanities and history. I am interested in this course because it fulfills the requirements for the DH minor and the Writing-intensive. I also love to write, and I have considered adding it as another minor. Also, I believe knowing how to write online is an extremely valuable skill to have in today's world, as it seems that everything is done digitally. Last semester I took Introduction to Digital Humanities with Dr. Stover and found the discipline fascinating, so I’m glad to continue studying it while improving my writing skills.

I am a Communication major because I love learning about how people talk to each other and how to do it more effectively. **Learning the skill of communication is helping me to become a better person** because I am learning how the world works and how I can improve it. One of the first classes I took was **interpersonal communication,** and it was terrific. I did a project on an aspect of communication that I can work on and how to improve it. I had never taken a class where I could personalize it that much and is so applicable to the world.

Along with my academic ambitions, I am involved with two sororities on campus. I am a member of [Delta Gamma](https://www.deltagamma.org/) and the music sorority [Nu Kappa Epsilon](http://nukappaepsilonmusicsorority.blogs.wm.edu/) which we are the Beta chapter for. The alpha chapter is at William and Mary. Nu Kappa Epsilon currently has nine members, so when I tell most people I am a part of it, they have not heard of it. For Nu Kappa Epsilon, I am the Historian, PR chair, and Design chair. I am newly elected, so I haven’t fulfilled all of my roles yet, but I am currently making the [sorority’s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) more engaging.

I have had a lot of fun running the Instagram. Before, not much was done with it, so I can have *almost free reign* with how I run it. I have created graphics, started theme days, and am posting a lot in preparation for our recruitment. I have never run an Instagram, but I am learning and tailoring it to represent the chapter accurately. 

Now that I have talked about my campus life let me mention some other aspects of myself. Like most of the CNU community, I am from NOVA. I live about thirty minutes from DC, and it's pretty cool to be so close. I don’t have any pets, but I have a younger brother who can be pretty annoying, but I love him anyway. 

Another aspect of myself is fandoms. I am part of many, like marvel, the TV arrowverse, and Gilmore Girls, but at my core, I love sci-fi, and I am a Star Trek fan. I grew up watching *Star Trek Next Generation* with my mom, and it has become a comfort show because I have seen all of the episodes many times. **It’s incredible to think that our technology could be that advanced one day, and we could live as they do**

Lastly, I will discuss my future, which is a scary thought. I’m unsure what I want to do, but I know what disciplines I want to study. I want a job after college, and I don’t see myself going to graduate school immediately after I get my undergraduate degree. My major is broad, and my minors go well, so I hope to find something that I like through internship opportunities and summer jobs. I hope that I can find a job that I enjoy doing one day.
