## Reflection on my first time using Oxygen

  I was assigned a portion of Dracula's Guest by Brahm Stoker to encode using TEI (Text Encoding Initiative). Dracula's Guest is a short story that seems to be about Dracula and Jonathan Harker; however, there is no proof of this. The style is different than the novel, Dracula, and there is no way to identify the main character as Harker. I was assigned to encode from the end of page 14 through some of 15. This passage is about soldiers discussing the main character's condition and how to help him. I used Oxygen to encode the passage. Oxygen is software that uses TEI, a standard set of Extended Markup Language (XML) tags to encode digital editions.
  
 We began this assignment with our portions in google drive. We used the comment feature to mark any paragraph beginnings, page beginnings, quotes, notes, and EM dashes.

My section had many quotes as it was mainly soldiers talking and the narrator listening. This step was beneficial because I thought coding would be complicated when my professor explained the project. I was able to organize everything I had to code, which made it seem more manageable. I had an itemized list of precisely what I needed to do, and I felt confident I could do it. It also helped when I started using Oxygen because I knew I wouldn't be missing anything since I had gone through and carefully marked up everything I needed to code.

  The first time I opened Oxygen, I was overwhelmed. It looked very complicated, and there was daunting code everywhere. A brief tutorial from my professor helped me with a basic understanding, but I still managed to mess up the header and needed help to fix it. I realized how important attention to detail is because I put some things in the wrong place and had to go back and edit carefully.

  We used the school computers, which were MacBooks, and I do not normally use one. So, there was a bit of a learning curve, and it felt uncomfortable using an unfamiliar computer operating system, but I got assistance from my professor and was able to figure it out.

  As I started using Oxygen, I was surprised by how easy it is to use. I assumed it would be hard because I’ve always thought of coding as a complex language that I would never be able to understand. In my first semester, I took Introduction to Computer Science, so I knew about opening and closing tags and basic tags like paragraph and quote, but I had never put them into practice. As I kept working, I enjoyed the structure of the tags.

  I had to open the tag, copy and paste the text from the google doc and then close the tag. For the same formatting feature like quotes, I used the same tag. I followed the same order of steps for the whole passage. I like to follow the same structure and steps for my work, which I could do with tags. As I kept coding, I understood the tags, where to put them, and how to use them.
  
  I came into this project with a minimal amount of coding knowledge. Since I am going to minor in digital humanities, I think it’s essential to have a bit of knowledge about coding because it could help me understand what’s going on in the field. I don’t think I will ever be a fantastic programmer, but this project made me less afraid of coding and gave me a basic understanding of  how to do it.
