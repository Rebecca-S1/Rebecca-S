  Monroe and Florence Work Today (MFWT) is a project about the work of Monroe Work, who lived from 1866 to 1945, and his wife, Florence. They documented every known lynching in the U.S. during their lives. His records are essential because most people only heard about some lynchings in newspapers, but he made an account of everything. Using todayâ€™s modern technology, MFWT provides people with a single place to find interactive maps, text, letters, timelines, and information. People can see how pervasive lynching was and learn why, how, and where it happened. 
  
  The MFWT site is easy to use. Users scroll to read each section, and when they reach the end of the page, they can click a text box to go to the next section. At the top of the page, some buttons allow users to skip to different areas and jump to other parts of the website. These options work well, and can get a user to another section quickly.
  
The MFWT website accommodates Spanish as well as English speakers. There is an option at the top of the page to change the language. ![Text of Monroe and Florence Today website in spanish](https://Rebecca-S1.github.io/Rebecca-S/images/Spanish.jpg) This is an essential feature because it makes the information, which is a significant part of American history, more accessible. 

As users scroll through the website, new background pictures appear. These visually appealing photos provide clear context that it is a new section. However, the pictures appear behind the text, so it is hard to see them. Even though users can scroll slower to view the background image before reading the text for that page, it is still challenging to appreciate the picture. ![Text in front of a newspaper](https://Rebecca-S1.github.io/Rebecca-S/images/Newspaper.jpg) It would be helpful if the background photos also had captions to contextualize them. Another option is to have a gallery of the images with descriptions to see what they represent.

There are also various links that provide extra information through quotes, videos, or letters.
