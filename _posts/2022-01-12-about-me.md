## My name is Rebecca Sitrin....

...and I am a sophomore here at CNU. My pronouns are she/her, and I am majoring in Communication with minors in Digital Humanities and History. I am interested in this course because it fulfills the requirements for the DH minor and the CNU writing-intensive. I love to write, and I have considered adding it as another minor. I believe knowing how to write online is an extremely valuable skill to have in today's world, as it seems that everything is done digitally. Last semester I took Introduction to Digital Humanities with Dr. Stover and found the discipline fascinating, so I’m glad to continue studying it while improving my writing skills.

I am a Communication major because I love learning about how people talk to each other and how to do it more effectively. **Learning the skill of communication is helping me to become a better person** because I am learning how the world works and how I can improve it. One of the first classes I took was **interpersonal communication,** and it was terrific. I did a project on an aspect of communication on which I have room to improve. **I had never taken a class where I could personalize my work that much.**

Along with my academic ambitions, I am involved with **two sororities on campus**: [Delta Gamma](https://www.deltagamma.org/) and the music sorority [Nu Kappa Epsilon](http://nukappaepsilonmusicsorority.blogs.wm.edu/), for which we are the Beta Chapter. The Alpha Chapter is at William and Mary. Nu Kappa Epsilon currently has **nine** members, so when I tell most people I am a member, they have not heard of it. For Nu Kappa Epsilon, I am the Historian, PR Chair, and Design Chair. I am newly elected, so I haven’t fulfilled all of my roles yet, but I am currently making the [sorority’s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) more engaging.

**I am having a lot of fun running the Instagram**. Before, not much was done with it, so I can have *almost free reign* with how I run it. I have created graphics, started theme days, and am posting a lot in preparation for our recruitment. I have never run an Instagram, but I am learning and tailoring it to represent the chapter accurately. 

Now that I have talked about my campus life let me mention some other aspects of myself. Like many in the CNU community, I am from NOVA. I live about thirty minutes from DC, and it's pretty cool to be so close. I don’t have any pets, but I have a younger brother who can be pretty annoying, but I love him anyway. 

Another aspect of myself is fandoms. I am part of many, like Marvel, the TV Arrowverse, and Gilmore Girls, but at my core, I love sci-fi, and I am a Star Trek fan. I grew up watching *Star Trek Next Generation* with my mom, and it has become a comfort show because I have seen all of the episodes many times. **It’s incredible to think that our technology could be that advanced one day, and we could live as they do.**

Lastly, I will discuss my future, which is a scary thought. I’m unsure what I want to do for a career, even though I know what disciplines I'd like to study. I want a job after college; I don’t see myself going to graduate school immediately after I get my undergraduate degree. I hope to find something that I like through internship opportunities, campus jobs, and summer jobs.
