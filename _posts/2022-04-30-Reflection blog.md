## Course Reflection
  Coming into this course after taking Introduction to Digital Humanities (DH) last semester, I thought I had a solid and well-formulated definition of Digital Humanities. My definition included interactive projects, incorporating research, and making a well-reasoned argument. Now that I have taken this course, I have expanded my definition. New elements include how arguments can be made through the project's format and content. Projects must be interactive. DH can include projects where you code and put texts and old documents into a digital format.  Previously, I had never thought about how digitizing texts can be considered DH. I learned about digitizing texts through the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) project.

  For this project, I was assigned a portion of Dracula’s Guest by Brahm Stoker to encode using TEI on Oxygen. Oxygen is a standard set of Extended Markup Language (XML) tags to encode digital editions. I had to encode from the end of page 14 through some of page 15. This passage is about soldiers discussing the main character’s condition and how to help him. 

  When I started this project, I was very nervous and intimidated by the coding aspect because I had always thought of code as a confusing language that would take a long time to understand. Also, looking at the examples and opening Oxygen for the first time was intimidating. As I began working on the project, I found that coding was not as complicated as I thought. I was able to encode my short passage relatively quickly and found the coding structure enjoyable. I was proud of the end product and that I was able to code something that worked.

   This project helped me understand the complexities of DH because I knew that coding was a part of DH, but I always thought of coding as a complex language that I could never master. I thought that to code for DH, you had to do complicated programming that took a long time. This project showed me that you do not have to be a master coder to engage in the coding and programming side of DH. You can use simple code to create meaningful DH projects. Projects that encode digital editions also allow texts to become more accessible because today, many people have the internet. It is easier for most people to read a book online than buy a physical copy. So, more people can read these texts. Along with the TEI project, another project helped improve my understanding of DH.

  The other project that taught me about DH was the grant-writing assignment. We had to develop an idea for a DH project and write a grant proposal for it. When reading about this assignment in the course syllabus, I was nervous about coming up with an idea for a DH project and writing the grant. As the time came to brainstorm ideas, I eventually came up with creating an interactive Twine fiction told from the perspective of a Palestinian who was forced to leave home during the 1948 war. I got this idea from a primary source reading we did on the war in my class called Israel/Palestine: One Land Two Peoples. The reading was Salaman Sittas's book “Mapping My Return: A Palestinian Memoir,” which is about his experience of being forced out of Palestine during the war as a child
