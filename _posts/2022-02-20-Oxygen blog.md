## Reflection on my first time using Oxygen

  I was assigned a portion of Dracula's Guest by Brahm Stoker to encode using TEI (Text Encoding Initiative). Dracula's Guest is a short story that seems to be about Dracula and Jonathan Harker; however, there is no proof of this. The style is different than the novel, Dracula, and there is no way to identify the main character as Harker. I was assigned to encode from the end of page 14 through some of 15. This passage is about soldiers discussing the main character's condition and how to help him. I used Oxygen to encode the passage. Oxygen is software that uses TEI, a standard set of Extended Markup Language (XML) tags to encode digital editions.
  We began this assignment with our portions in google drive. We used the comment feature to mark any paragraph beginnings, page beginnings, quotes, notes, and EM dashes.
